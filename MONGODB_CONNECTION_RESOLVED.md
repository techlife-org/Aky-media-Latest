# MongoDB Connection Fix - Implementation Complete

## Summary

We have successfully fixed the MongoDB connection issue in the AKY Media application. The error "querySrv ECONNREFUSED _mongodb._tcp.techlife.yonsh1a.mongodb.net" was caused by DNS resolution problems with the MongoDB Atlas SRV record.

## Root Cause

The issue was related to DNS SRV record lookup failing, which is a common problem in some network environments. The MongoDB driver was unable to resolve the SRV record for the MongoDB Atlas cluster.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced MongoDB Connection Options
- **File**: `lib/mongodb.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added DNS resolution options (`srvMaxHosts`, `srvServiceName`)
  - Increased timeouts for better reliability
  - Added direct connection fallback mechanism
  - Improved error handling with specific fallback logic

### 2. Enhanced Fallback MongoDB Connection
- **File**: `lib/mongodb-fallback.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated connection options to match main connection file
  - Added DNS resolution fallback mechanism
  - Increased timeouts for better reliability
  - Added direct connection fallback when SRV lookup fails

### 3. Connection Testing
- **Files**: 
  - `test-mongo-simple.js` (new)
  - `test-mongodb-connection.js` (updated)
- **Changes**:
  - Created simple connection test script
  - Verified MongoDB connection is working correctly

## How It Works Now

1. **Primary Connection**: Attempts to connect using standard MongoDB Atlas SRV URI
2. **DNS Fallback**: If SRV lookup fails, tries direct connection to MongoDB cluster
3. **Enhanced Timeouts**: Uses longer timeouts to accommodate network latency
4. **Error Handling**: Provides specific error messages for different failure scenarios

## Verification

The MongoDB connection has been successfully tested and verified:
- ✅ Connection to MongoDB Atlas established
- ✅ Database ping successful
- ✅ Database operations working
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms in place

## Database Details

Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas cluster with the following databases available:
- aky-media (main application database)
- akywebsite
- digitalSummit_kano
- techlife-puffingroup
- And several others

## Files Modified

### Modified Files:
1. `lib/mongodb.ts` - Main MongoDB connection with enhanced options
2. `lib/mongodb-fallback.ts` - Fallback connection with DNS resolution improvements

### New Files:
1. `test-mongo-simple.js` - Simple MongoDB connection test script

## Next Steps

The MongoDB connection is now working properly. The application should be able to:
1. Connect to the MongoDB Atlas database without DNS resolution issues
2. Handle network timeouts gracefully
3. Fall back to direct connection when SRV lookup fails
4. Maintain stable database connections for all application features

No further action is required for the MongoDB connection issue.
